  {
    question: "How can the cheapest plan be priced this low?",
    answer: `Three factors. First, there is no satellite hardware or engineer visit to subsidise — the service runs entirely over broadband. Second, every plan is a one-time payment, so there is no recurring billing overhead per subscriber. Third, longer commitments unlock deeper discounts; the Diamond plan at £${diamond.price.toFixed(
      2
    )} for two years works out to £${diamond.perMonth.toFixed(
      2
    )} per month because the cost of acquiring that subscriber is amortised across twenty-four months instead of three.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Is the cheapest plan also the best plan for me?",
    answer:
      "Not always. The lowest per-month price comes from the longest commitment, which suits households that already know they want the service for two years. For someone who has never tried IPTV before, the three-month Bronze plan is the rational starting point — the per-month rate is higher, but the total spend exposed is lower, and the thirty-day refund window covers the first month regardless.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does the cheapest plan miss out on any channels or features?",
    answer:
      "No. Every plan ships with the identical 37,000-channel line-up, 198,000 on-demand titles, 4K UHD quality, full EPG, seven-day catch-up and five simultaneous screens. The built-in VPN is also included on every plan. Price differences come from term length alone, not from feature gating.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there hidden fees I should know about?",
    answer:
      "None. The price shown at checkout is the total charged to your card or PayPal — VAT included. There is no setup fee, no activation fee, no per-device surcharge and no separate sport or cinema add-on. There is also no automatic renewal at the end of the term, so no surprise charge to forget about.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the price locked for the full term?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The price paid at sign-up covers the entire plan length — three, six, twelve or twenty-four months. Whatever happens to list pricing during your active term, the rate you locked in is the rate that applies. If you renew later, you renew at whatever the published price is at that moment.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the refund actually work if I want to claim it?",
    answer:
      "Open live chat or send a WhatsApp message inside the first thirty days, state that you want a refund, and the original payment method is credited the same working day. No form to fill in, no proof required, no retention call. The thirty-day window applies equally whether you bought the Bronze plan or the Diamond plan.",

            &ldquo;Cheapest IPTV&rdquo; is a phrase that has been worn out by every operator in the
            market, so it is worth defining what cheap actually means here. cheap-iptv.tv
            publishes four fixed-term plans — the lowest works out to £{diamond.perMonth.toFixed(2)}{" "}
            per month, the highest sits at £{bronze.perMonth.toFixed(2)} per month. There are no
            discounted-then-rebilled tiers, no separate sport bundles and no VPN sold on the side.

              Each plan is a single up-front payment for a fixed term of access. Nothing rebills,

                against per-month savings cleanly.

            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              The deeper discount on longer terms is not a marketing trick — it reflects the
              underlying cost of supporting a subscriber. A two-year customer amortises the
              acquisition and onboarding cost across twenty-four months instead of three, so the
              per-month price can come down without squeezing margin. The same logic underpins the

              What the low price does — and does not — change
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              The clearest signal that a cheap IPTV plan is honestly priced is that it does not
              quietly strip features. On cheap-iptv.tv, every plan ships with the identical feature
              set. The Bronze subscriber gets the same 37,000-channel line-up as the Diamond
              subscriber. The 4K UHD streaming quality, the seven-day catch-up window, the five
              simultaneous-screen cap and the full electronic programme guide are present on all
              four plans without exception.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              The built-in VPN is also included at every price point. Many cheap IPTV providers
              upsell the VPN as a separate monthly add-on; here it travels with the base plan and
              adds no measurable latency to the stream. The thirty-day refund window applies to
              every plan length, and the instant-activation flow — credentials emailed inside
              sixty seconds — is the same whether the order is for three months or two years.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              What does change with the lower-priced plans is the contractual length. A cheaper
              per-month rate is bundled into a longer up-front payment. That is the only
              meaningful trade-off across the line-up. Households that prefer to commit for a
              shorter period accept a higher per-month rate; households happy to commit for two
              years collect a deeper discount. Either way, the experience inside the app is
              identical, and the engineering behind the player — covered on the{" "}

            </h2>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              A cheap headline price is only meaningful if you can walk away from it. Every plan
              on cheap-iptv.tv carries a thirty-day money-back guarantee that is honoured exactly
              as published in the{" "}
              <Link

                refund policy
              </Link>
              . The trigger is simple: contact support inside thirty days of payment, say you want
              a refund, and the original card or PayPal account is credited on the same working
              day.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              The guarantee does not require a reason. It is not conditional on a minimum number
              of streaming hours. It does not invoke a tiered partial-refund schedule based on how
              many days you have used. Inside the window, the full amount comes back. Outside the
              window, the plan continues to its end date and then quietly expires unless you
              choose to renew. No subscription manager required, no automated charge to dispute.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              The reason the guarantee can be unconditional on the cheap plans is straightforward:
              the refund rate sits below industry norms because the service performs as
              advertised. If a household tries the cheapest plan and decides it is not the right
              fit, the support team would rather refund quickly than fight the customer — the
              alternative is a chargeback that costs more and damages the merchant account. The
              maths favours an open refund window.

            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              The four plans map onto four common viewing patterns. The Bronze three-month plan
              suits trial-stage households: people who have switched away from premium UK pay-TV,
              want to confirm the cheap option works for them, and would rather expose £
              {bronze.price.toFixed(2)} than commit to a longer term. It is also the right pick
              for short-term tenants, students living in halls for a single term, and gift
              purchasers who want to fund a relative&apos;s subscription without forcing a
              two-year commitment on them.

            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              The Silver six-month plan suits seasonal viewers. A six-month window covers a full
              sport season, a winter of box-sets or a summer of cinema without overshooting into
              periods where the household is travelling or not watching much. It is also a useful
              middle option for households that want a longer trial than the Bronze plan offers
              without committing to a full year.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              The Gold annual plan is the most-chosen plan and suits typical UK households: a
              standard residential set-up that wants live UK sports, free-to-air UK channels,
              films and on-demand content year-round at a settled price. The Diamond two-year plan
              suits long-term residents and households that have already used the service for one
              term and want to lock in the deepest discount on renewal. For an alternative cut of

              How the headline price compares to traditional pay-TV
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              A premium UK pay-TV package — the kind with live sport, cinema and a multi-room
              upgrade — typically sits around seventy to eighty pounds per month on a fixed
              eighteen- or twenty-four-month contract. That is before broadband line rental, before
              the box-rental fee and before any separate streaming service bolted on the side.
              Annualised, the household commits roughly nine hundred to a thousand pounds for a
              year of viewing.

              The annual Gold plan on cheap-iptv.tv comes in at £{gold.price.toFixed(2)} for the
              same twelve months. The annual saving against a traditional bundle works out to
              roughly eight to nine hundred pounds. The Diamond two-year plan stretches the saving
              further by amortising the up-front payment across twenty-four months, at £
              {diamond.perMonth.toFixed(2)} per month.

              The comparison is not strictly like-for-like — premium pay-TV bundles include hardware
              and engineer install that cheap-iptv.tv does not, while cheap-iptv.tv includes a
              built-in VPN and a far larger channel count than most traditional packages publish.
              The point is structural: the cheapest published IPTV price in Britain replaces a
              premium pay-TV bundle for a fraction of the annual outlay, with no contract lock and
              a thirty-day refund window. Full pricing detail across the four tiers sits on the{" "}
