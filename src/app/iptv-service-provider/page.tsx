  {
    question: "Are you a UK-based IPTV service provider?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The company is operated from London with a British support rota covering twenty-four hours a day. The streaming infrastructure uses UK edge caches, the support team is in-country, and the refund mechanism honours UK consumer-protection norms — same-day return on a credit-card payment, no questions asked inside the thirty-day window.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the cheapest plan you offer?",
    answer: `The entry plan is Bronze at £${bronze.price.toFixed(
      2
    )} for three months of access — roughly £${bronze.perMonth.toFixed(
      2
    )} per month. The most popular plan is Gold at £${gold.price.toFixed(
      2
    )} for a full year, which works out to £${gold.perMonth.toFixed(
      2
    )} per month and remains the deepest practical discount for typical households. A full side-by-side comparison sits on the cheapest IPTV page.`,
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly does support actually reply?",
    answer:
      "Median first-response time is under four minutes during UK daytime hours on live chat and WhatsApp, and under fifteen minutes overnight. Email tends to be slower simply because email queues are checked in batches, so for time-sensitive issues the chat or WhatsApp channels resolve fastest.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if the service goes down during a big match?",
    answer:
      "Anti-Freeze logic switches the player to a sibling source within a couple of seconds when a stall is detected, so most short interruptions are invisible to the viewer. For wider incidents that affect a region or a partner feed, a public status note is posted and affected accounts receive a service credit automatically against the next renewal — no claim form to fill in.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I really get a refund inside thirty days with no questions?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The refund policy is unconditional inside the thirty-day window. Contact support, request the refund, and the original payment method is credited on the same working day. No reason is required, no retention call follows and no part of the term has to be served before requesting it.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How is cheap-iptv.tv different from a traditional UK pay-TV provider?",
    answer:
      "Traditional pay-TV runs on a long monthly contract with an engineer install and a tiered upgrade path for sport and cinema. cheap-iptv.tv runs on a one-time payment for a fixed term with everything included — live UK sports, films, kids, news and on-demand — and no equipment to install beyond an app on a device you already own.",

            </h2>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              cheap-iptv.tv is a small British IPTV service provider serving
              roughly fifty thousand UK households. The team is deliberately
              compact — engineers who maintain the streaming stack, support
              agents who handle live chat and email, and a content desk that
              updates the on-demand library and EPG. Everyone reports into a
              single director, which means problems escalate fast and
              decisions land within a single working day.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              The service launched as a response to two recurring complaints
              about premium UK pay-TV: the monthly bill is high, and the
              contract is rigid. Subscribers wanted top-tier UK football,
              free-to-air UK channels, popular box sets and on-demand films on
              the same login, without paying separately for sport, cinema and
              broadband bundles they did not need. The cheap-iptv.tv catalogue
              is built to meet that exact brief — 37,000 live channels and
              roughly 198,000 on-demand titles, all reachable from one app and
              one bill.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              The company is operated from London with a UK-based support rota
              covering twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. If you would

              How the service is operated day to day
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              An IPTV service provider lives or dies on three boring
              operational habits: published prices, predictable billing and
              clear cancellation terms. cheap-iptv.tv runs all three on the
              front foot.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              Every price visible on the site is the price charged at
              checkout. There is no introductory rate that resets at month
              four, no auto-enrolled add-on and no separate VPN subscription
              pushed on top of the headline plan. The four published plans
              cover three, six, twelve and twenty-four months of access. Each
              is paid once at sign-up, and the credentials arrive by email
              inside sixty seconds — not the next working day.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              Cancellation is equally direct. Because each plan is a one-time
              payment for a fixed term, there is no recurring card charge to
              dispute, no contract to escape and no early-termination fee.
              When the term ends, the subscription simply expires unless
              renewed manually. That structure removes the silent-renewal
              complaints that plague many traditional pay-TV services.
            </p>

              How streaming stability is engineered
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              The streaming backbone runs on UK data centres rather than a
              single overseas origin. The architecture uses regional edge
              caches inside Britain so the path between the broadcast feed and
              your living room stays inside the country wherever possible —
              fewer transit hops, lower latency and a smaller surface area for
              packet loss during peak Saturday evenings.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              Each feed is transcoded to multiple adaptive-bitrate ladders.
              The player negotiates the highest rung your broadband can
              sustain in real time, then steps down gracefully rather than
              freezing the frame when bandwidth dips. The result is a 4K UHD
              feed when conditions allow and a smooth Full HD fallback when
              they do not. There is no manual quality toggle to fiddle with
              mid-match.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              Anti-Freeze logic sits on the streaming server, identifies a
              stalled segment within a couple of seconds and switches the
              client to a sibling source automatically. Most viewers never
              notice the swap. When wider outages do occur — the kind that
              affect a whole region or a single broadcast partner — they are
              posted on the public status feed and credited automatically
              against the next renewal.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              The same engineering applies regardless of plan. Whether a
              household pays £{bronze.price.toFixed(2)} for the three-month
              Bronze plan or £{diamond.price.toFixed(2)} for the two-year
              Diamond plan, the streaming quality, the catch-up window and
              the simultaneous-screen count are identical. Plan length
              controls discount depth, not feature access — a deliberate
              choice, not an accidental one.

              Most IPTV service providers list 24/7 support and quietly mean
              an automated ticketing system. cheap-iptv.tv runs a live human
              rota on three channels: web live chat, WhatsApp and email.
              Average first-response time across the rolling thirty-day
              window stays under four minutes during UK daytime hours and
              under fifteen minutes overnight.

              Every agent is a named member of the British support team — no
              outsourcing to a third-party operations centre — and each agent
              has full access to subscription, billing and refund tooling on
              the same screen. That matters because most support tickets
              resolve faster when the agent can see your account in real
              time and act on it without escalation. Resetting a password,
              switching an active session to a new device, refunding within
              the guarantee window or rerouting a stream to a different
              source all happen inside the same chat thread.

              Billing itself is a one-time transaction. There is no stored
              recurring authorisation, which means there is nothing to
              forget to cancel — a structural difference compared with
              traditional pay-TV subscriptions that rebill silently each
              month. When a plan reaches its term, access simply stops
              unless you actively renew. The renewal is initiated by you,
              not by an automated charge.

              VAT is built into the prices shown on the site. A receipt
              arrives by email immediately after payment and is downloadable
              from the same email link for HMRC or expense purposes. For
              households that pay through PayPal, the merchant descriptor on
              the statement reads as the trading name displayed at checkout,
              so the line item is easy to recognise on the bank or card
              statement.
