  {
    question: "Why is this IPTV subscription so cheap?",
    answer:
      "No satellite dishes, no engineer visits, no high-street retail costs. A lean digital infrastructure delivers 37,000 channels and 198,000 on-demand titles directly over broadband. The savings pass straight to the subscriber.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does cheap IPTV mean poor quality?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely not. Every plan includes native 4K UHD, adaptive bitrate streaming and Anti-Freeze technology. Picture quality matches or exceeds satellite. Budget pricing reflects operational efficiency, not compromised content.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does the cheapest plan cost?",
    answer:
      "The three-month Bronze plan is £25.99 in total, which works out to about £8.66 per month. Longer commitments lower the per-month cost further — the 24-month Diamond plan drops to £3.33 per month, the cheapest published rate, saving 60 percent against short-term equivalents.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a hidden fee for 4K or VPN?",
    answer:
      "Zero hidden fees. 4K UHD, built-in VPN, five screens, EPG, 7-day catch-up and 24/7 support are included in every plan at no extra charge. The price on the checkout page is the price paid.",
  },
  {
    question: "How fast is activation after payment?",
    answer:
      "Under sixty seconds. M3U credentials and app login arrive by email the instant payment clears. No manual review, no office-hours restriction. Instant activation on every cheap plan.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can more than one screen watch at the same time?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Every subscription supports five simultaneous streams. Parents, children and housemates can all watch different channels in 4K at the same time on a single account.",
  },
  {
    question: "What devices are supported?",
    answer:
      "Amazon Firestick, Android TV, Samsung Tizen, LG webOS, Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, Android phones, MAG boxes, Formuler, Enigma2, Windows PC and Mac. Six apps are officially supported with setup guides.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a money-back guarantee?",
    answer:
      "Every plan comes with a 30-day refund guarantee. If the service does not meet expectations, contact support and every penny returns same-day. No forms, no retention calls.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does this compare to traditional pay-TV?",
    answer:
      "A premium pay-TV bundle with sports and cinema costs roughly seventy-five pounds per month on a 24-month contract. This cheap IPTV subscription delivers 37,000 channels from £3.33/month with no lock-in. More content, lower price, greater flexibility.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is a separate VPN required?",
    answer:
      "No. A full VPN is built into every plan at no extra cost. It adds no measurable latency and requires no separate app. Privacy is included, not sold as an add-on.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why choose cheap-iptv.tv over other IPTV providers?",
    answer:
      "37,000 channels, 198,000 films, 4K UHD, VPN, five screens, 60-second activation and 24/7 UK support — all from a single low monthly rate. No other IPTV provider in Britain matches this combination at this price point.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this the best cheap IPTV UK service?",
    answer:
      "It is built to be. A best cheap IPTV UK service has to win on more than price: 37,000+ channels with full UK coverage, native 4K UHD, a built-in VPN, five simultaneous screens, instant activation and a genuine 30-day money-back guarantee — all included on every plan, backed by a named British support team. Cheap-iptv.tv pairs the lowest published prices with that complete feature set, which is what makes it one of the best-value cheap IPTV UK options available.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I buy a cheap IPTV subscription?",
    answer:
      "Choose a plan in the pricing section, complete a one-time payment by card or PayPal, and your login arrives by email within about sixty seconds. There is no contract and no stored card — the cheap IPTV subscription runs for its fixed term and simply expires unless you renew. Every plan is covered by the 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can buy and test it risk-free.",
